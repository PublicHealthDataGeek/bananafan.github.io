## About me

I am studying for a PhD in Data Analytics in Society at the University of Leeds in the [Leeds Institute of Data Analytics](https://lida.leeds.ac.uk/study-training/datacdt/).

I am doing this as part of my training to be a [Consultant in Public Health](https://www.healthcareers.nhs.uk/explore-roles/public-health/roles-public-health/public-health-consultants-and-specialists).

My PhD will involve looking at the impact of investment in cycling infrastructure on the normalisation of cycling in London.  My main supervisor is [Dr Roger Beecham](https://www.geog.leeds.ac.uk/people/r.beecham).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/bananafan/bananafan.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
